# NU-aly6010-Life-Expectancy-Dataset

Introduction

The dataset related to life expectancy consists of 22 columns and 2938 rows which have 20 numeric variables. I dropped the character variables of “Country” and “Status” out of the dataset to run a whole correlation table. After getting the initial overview, I decided to choose these variables to make further correlation and regression analysis: “Life.expectancy” (Life Expectancy in age), “Alcohol” (recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in liters of pure alcohol)), “BMI” (Average Body Mass Index of the entire population), “GDP” (Gross Domestic Product per capita (in USD), and “Schooling” (Number of years of Schooling(years)).
